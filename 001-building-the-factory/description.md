## Module One

We are going to build a "Zombie Factory" to build an army of zombies.

- Our factory will maintain a database of all zombies in our army
- Our factory will have a function for creating new zombies
- Each zombie will have a random and unique appearance
- In later lessons, we'll add more functionality, like giving zombies the ability to attack humans or other zombies! But before we get there, we have to add the basic functionality of creating new zombies.

## How Zombie DNA Works

The zombie's appearance will be based on its "Zombie DNA". 

Zombie DNA is simple â€” it's a 16-digit integer, like:

`8356281049284737`

Just like real DNA, different parts of this number will map to different traits. The first 2 digits map to the zombie's head type, the second 2 digits to the zombie's eyes, etc.

Note: For this project, we've kept things simple, and our zombies can have only 7 different types of heads (even though 2 digits allow 100 possible options). 

Later on we could add more head types if we wanted to increase the number of zombie variations.

For example, the first 2 digits of our example DNA above are 83. To map that to the zombie's head type, we do 83 % 7 + 1 = 7. So this Zombie would have the 7th zombie head type.
